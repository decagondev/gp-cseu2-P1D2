# how to define a function
# def someFunc(x):
#     return x

def cap(n):
    return n.capitalize()
# define a doubling function that passes args by value

# define a doubling function that passes args by reference

    # no return necessary -
    # passing by reference means that
    # original list is modified

# try out our functions
# var1 = someFunc("Hello") # => "Hello"
print(name) # => "dave"
cap(name) # => "Dave" pass by val
print(name) # => "dave"
