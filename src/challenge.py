# Return the "centered" average of a list of ints, 
# which we'll say is the mean average of the values, 
# except ignoring the largest and smallest values in the array. 
# if there are multiple copies of largest or smallest values. ignore only 1 of min / max respectively
# the input list may be unsorted
# you may assume that the list is length 3 or more

# you can make your own sort or you can use a sort function built in


# centered_average([1, 2, 3, 4, 100]) → 3
# centered_average([1, 1, 5, 5, 10, 8, 7]) → 5
# centered_average([-10, -4, -2, -4, -2, 0]) → -3
